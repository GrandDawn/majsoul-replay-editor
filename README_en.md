# Majsoul Replay Editor (雀魂回放编辑器)

[中文](README.md) | English

Injection scripts for custom Majsoul replay files, plus a collection of user-made replay scripts. Works on the Majsoul web client for CN / JP / US regions.

## Disclaimer

This is a third-party script. The operator (Catfood Studio) may ban accounts. Please log in with a test/secondary account when experimenting. The maintainer is not responsible for any losses caused by bans or other risks.

If your account is banned, you may request account deletion via email (CN servers: **cs@catfoodstudio.com** or **cs@maj-soul.com**). After receiving the confirmation email, reply to it; 15 days later you can register again using the same email.

## Usage

### Quick start

Open [main.js](main.js) and any replay JS file under [examples](examples) or [products](products) (for example: [demo.js](examples/demo.js)).

On a computer, log into Majsoul Web (use a test account). Press F12 to open DevTools → Console. Copy-paste the entire contents of `main.js` into the console and execute it. Then copy-paste the replay script and execute it as well.

Note: If you see the warning shown below when pasting into the console, you need to type `allow pasting` first (or `允许粘贴` in Chinese), then paste the scripts.

Now open any replay on the site, and you should see the custom replay.

### Authoring guide

The section above is enough for running examples. For detailed editing, read the docs below.

The original repository used GitHub Wiki as documentation. For easier maintenance, the docs have been moved into the [doc](doc) folder.

Recommended reading order:

1. [Edit game information](doc/1_编辑游戏信息.md)
2. [Edit each round](doc/2_编辑每个小局.md)
3. [Operation functions](doc/3_对局操作相关函数.md)
4. (Optional) [Operation functions (Event modes)](doc/4_对局操作相关函数（活动场）.md)
5. (Optional) [Advanced features](doc/5_部分进阶功能.md)
6. (Optional) [Recommended variables and helpers](doc/6_推荐使用变量函数汇总.md)
7. (Optional) [Miscellaneous](doc/7_其他杂项信息.md)

[Dictionary](doc/0_字典.md) is for quick look-ups while authoring replays. [字典_template](doc/字典_template.md) is a template used to generate the dictionary and does not need to be read.

---

To make maintenance and encapsulation easier, the project is currently being rewritten in TypeScript. The current `main.js` is compiled from the TypeScript files under [src](src).

How to compile from TS to JS:

1. Install Node.js and npm
2. Run `npm install` at the project root to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run build` to regenerate (overwrite) `main.js`

If you find bugs or behavior that doesn't match expectations, feel free to open an issue. You can also contact me on Bilibili: https://space.bilibili.com/372365985

If you'd like to author custom replays and follow new features, or contribute to the project, you can fork this repo to make version control easier.

     - Kong responsibility (包杠)
     - Aotenjou mode (not recommended; may crash at very high scores)
     - Furiten toggle
     - No-yaku false-win handling

2. [add_function.js](add_function.js) provides several modes that do not exist in the official client (see [自制模式](products/自制模式)). This file is hard to maintain, and may contain bugs.
   - [2-player Mahjong](products/自制模式/二人麻将)
   - [Open Riichi](products/自制模式/开立直)
   - [Blood Flow](products/自制模式/血流成河)

3. `main.js` also provides a Chinese National Standard (Guobiao) mode. I haven't played Guobiao myself, so there may be bugs. See [国标麻将](products/国标麻将).

4. Invalid inputs may crash the page (usually it freezes and the console reports errors).

5. More replays can be found under [products](products). You’re welcome to create your own.

## TODO (contributions welcome)

- Modularization: The current structure is somewhat messy. A refactor into a more modular design would help maintenance and extensions, but I haven’t found a suitable approach yet. It needs time for design and implementation.

- GUI (Graphical User Interface): Some users asked for a GUI to lower the barrier to writing scripts, but it’s unlikely in the short term because:
  - The core script doesn’t focus much on robustness, and stable behavior is hard to guarantee.
  - The core features are complex; even with a GUI you’d still need to read the docs.
  - GUI development effort is far larger than script work.
  - I’m not very familiar with GUI development.

Summary: “Spend effort where it matters.” A GUI offers low ROI right now, but contributors are welcome to implement it.
